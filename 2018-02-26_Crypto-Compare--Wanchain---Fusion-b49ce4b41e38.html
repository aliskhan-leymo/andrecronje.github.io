They do this by integrating to popular blockchains, registering the relevant token on their mainnet (so as an ERC20 or in this case WRC20 token), and then allowing internal transfer or manipulation until it needs to externally exit again.</p><p name="cbea" id="cbea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is blockchain intercommunication (at this point Aion is a bigger competitor, although they are facilitating a communication protocol, and not a financial one). So comparing this point to Fusion, the interesting difference here is usufruct. On wanchain you are in control of your asset from one wallet to the next, technically in Fusion you aren’t, Fusion uses it’s distributed key mechanism to allow you to remotely control your original token/coin in the original mainnet via ownership of a distributed private key. This already has different applications from a financial perspective.</p><p name="0843" id="0843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wanchain is fantastic for user A wanting to transfer 10 ETH to user B on the wanchain network, and then an equal trade amount of BTC back out to user A on the BTC network. Now think about an investment firm that wants to collect money from users to create a new fund and then invest this money. In the Wanchain example you would have to transfer those funds to the firm and trust that they will use it appropriately. With Fusion, since you only transfer usufruct and not the actual funds, that means that you are still in control of your funds, even though the firm can use it for investment purposes (assuming it does not exit the Fusion ecosystem). So the value proposition here is very different.</p><p name="2ca2" id="2ca2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Privacy</strong></p><p name="b85e" id="b85e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s look at Wanchain’s second primary objective, private transactions, this puts them in to the competitor space with Monero, PivX, Bitcoin Private, Fusion isn’t looking at private transactions (since that goes against DJ’s vision of inclusive and transparent). The interesting thing here, is by combining cross-chain and privacy transactions, Wanchain will allow any coin to become a privacy token. Essentially destroying the market for privacy coins, since now, if you want to do a private transaction with ETH, you simply transfer it to Wanchain’s mainnet, do the private transaction and transfer it out again. This is a very powerful value proposition. One not currently present or planned within the Fusion ecosystem.</p><p name="e6bb" id="e6bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Smart Contracts</strong></p><p name="9da1" id="9da1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next part we have to look at is smart contracts, Wanchain’s primay modification to smartcontracts is their PoS implementation to increase throughput, they are (for now) using the ethereum base contracts while they focus on privacy, inter-chain, and PoS. Fusion is primarily focused on smart contract adoption, by adding parallel processing (allow contracts to leverage parallel processing on multi core systems), sharding (allow for concurrent execution of multiple smart contracts), faster confirmation via bookkeeping nodes (PoS implementation), triggered (based on an external event) &amp; timed (set at a specific time) events. So the value proposition here (to me at least) is vastly different. Fusion’s focus is very clearly towards corporates modelling existing financial models into the blockchain (insurance, loans, derivatives), whereas Wanchain’s vision is the intercommunication of blockchains.</p><p name="dce8" id="dce8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Off-chain Data</strong></p><p name="0b64" id="0b64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fusion is natively integrating off-chain data into their bookkeeping nodes. This means that you will have external HTTP access to a lot of validated resources to allow for better building financial institutions, since very often these systems aren’t static. They will still do this by locking in the data into transactions, thus keeping the deterministic nature of a blockchain. At this point, Wanchain is not pursuing off-chain data integration. In this case it puts Fusion into competition with Oracles or ChainLink (to a much lesser extent since ChainLink will interconnect off-chain data into all blockchains, essentially providing this service for Wanchain)</p><p name="bcb8" id="bcb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion</strong></p><p name="a985" id="a985" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It might be that Wanchain’s focus will give them the advantage and Fusion are spreading themselves to thin, but that I’ll be able to answer as soon as the source code is released :) I’ve already analysed what Wanchain has done, so next is Fusion’s turn.</p><p name="a573" id="a573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From my point of view, I see the two as complimentary to one another, Wanchain will become an interconnected network for token transfer and swops with built in privacy, whereas Fusion will become a platform for financial institutions to adopt the blockchain. I could very easily see Fusion integrating into Wanchain to allow for private transactions off of distributed key control smart contracts, and I could see Wanchain integrating into Fusion to allow for investment funds, insurance, and loan products.</p><p name="6f49" id="6f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I believe these two are fantastic complements to one another and that they along with Ethereum will become a powerhouse network of intercommunication and real world financial adoption. I will definitely keep my eye on these 3.</p></div></div></section>
